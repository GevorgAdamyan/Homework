This is a simple password generator in JavaScript.
You can run the code in https://jsfiddle.net/ .
You should enter the number of the symbols of your password in pop-up window and then click "OK" button.
The system will return your password which will contain 1 uppercase letter, 2 special characters, 2 numbers and the rest of the symbols will be lowercase letters.
Note that will generate the password from 6 to 15 symbols, so you can enter the numbers 6-15, in other case the system will return "Invalid data" message.
You will get the same message, if you enter something else than numbers.
